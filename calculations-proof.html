Calculations for power, as according to <a href="https://www.renewablesfirst.co.uk/hydropower/hydropower-learning-centre/how-much-power-could-i-generate-from-a-hydro-turbine/">https://www.renewablesfirst.co.uk/hydropower/hydropower-learning-centre/how-much-power-could-i-generate-from-a-hydro-turbine/</a>
P = m x g x H x efficiency

m = flow rate
  this can be calculated by
    (radius of turbine * pi) * speed of river
    assuming river speed of 1.5m/s
    flow rate(m) = 0.015 x 1.5 = 0.0225m3/s = 22.5m3/s

g = 9.81m/s-1

head is an assumed 0.2m

efficiency of generator is assumed 50%

P = 22.5m3/s x 9.81m/s-1 x 0.2 x 0.5 = 22W
